In conversation with  
Madhuparna Dasgupta 
Director - Legal at Altico Advisors
The best way to approach any legal 
issue – whether as an external 
counsel or in-house counsel – is to 
be solution-oriented
- Madhuparna Dasgupta on the one piece of professional advice       
   that resonates with her.
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 2025 6
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 20257Please share your career progression following 
your tenure at Khaitan & Co. What motivated your 
transition to your current role as the Director - 
Legal at Altico Advisors?
I had recently been promoted to Partner at 
Khaitan & Co. when Altico approached me for 
a senior role in their legal team. At the same 
time, I had completed a decade in the law firm 
environment, dedicating myself to sustained 
vertical growth and establishing deep expertise 
in my practice area (Banking & Finance). Whilst 
I felt like I had achieved my personal goal of 
becoming a subject-matter expert, I saw this as 
the right opportunity to broaden my perspective 
and gain horizontal growth by diversifying 
my experience beyond a law firm setting. The 
transition to Altico allowed me to apply my law 
firm expertise in a new context while expanding 
my strategic and commercial acumen. Altico was 
also a client and I was familiar with their legal and 
investment teams and work ethic and this also 
helped with a smooth transition.
Based on your experience, how does working in 
a law firm environment differ from an in-house 
role?
The most apparent difference is that in a law firm 
you would be servicing multiple clients on specific 
assignments, typically requiring deep expertise in 
a particular field of law. Once you assume an in-
house legal role, your focus moves to providing 
legal support to a single organisation and 
handling a wide range of issues, from contracts 
and compliance to risk management and business 
strategy. Given that your involvement would go 
beyond completion of a legal mandate, there is 
a greater sense of ownership and a deeper and 
more practical understanding of the commercial 
objectives of a deal.
In your perspective, how do you foresee the role 
of legal counsel evolving in the coming years?
Traditionally, in-house legal teams were viewed 
as a cost center—a necessary but non-revenue-
generating function responsible for risk mitigation, 
compliance, and handling legal disputes. Legal 
teams often operating in silos, engaging with 
business functions only when required. Law 
firm associates would probably relate deeply to 
the frequent dilemma posed by ‘business team’ and ‘legal team’ comments appearing in drafts 
completely segregated and often at variance to 
each other! 
However, this perception has changed 
dramatically in recent years and I believe, will 
continue to evolve significantly in the coming 
years. General counsels are now frequently 
seen as business enablers and corporates have 
over time understood the importance and cost-
effectiveness of pre-emptive legal guidance at 
the inception or structuring stage of a deal rather 
than just legal risk vetting and damage control at 
an advanced stage. 
With this change in role and perspective towards 
an in-house counsel, the role of external legal 
counsel has also evolved significantly. Corporates 
would now expect external lawyers (steered with 
the help of in-house legal teams) to align their 
legal advice with business objectives and provide 
a holistic solution to legal issues, rather than 
restricting themselves to academic or theoretical 
responses; this expectation is also heightened 
in view of the recent advancements in AI and 
automated legal tech platforms and the external 
counsels would also need to keep abreast of 
these developments and leverage them to their 
advantage. 
Some key areas in my view where the role of 
external legal counsel is expected to evolve 
significantly are:
• Knowledge hubs: General counsels are 
increasingly relying on external legal advisors 
for providing real-time legal updates, thought 
leadership, and tailored regulatory insights. 
Firms that offer continuous knowledge 
management and legal foresight will stand 
out as indispensable partners in an evolving 
corporate landscape.
• Crisis management and risk mitigation: 
Corporate clients will increasingly turn to 
external counsel for crisis preparedness 
and response, particularly in areas like 
cybersecurity breaches, reputational risks, 
and regulatory investigations.
• Cross border expertise: As businesses expand 
into multiple jurisdictions, multinational 
corporations will demand lawyers whoAlumni in Focus 
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 20258
can navigate international trade laws, tax 
structures, and geopolitical risks, making global 
legal networks more valuable than ever.
What strategies do you implement to remain 
at the forefront of such a dynamic and ever-
changing industry?
Some key strategies would be to (1) communicate 
frequently with non-legal functions (investment, 
technical, HR, treasury) and participate actively 
in leadership discussions to gain an in-depth 
perspective of the commercials of a deal; (2) keep 
abreast of legal developments and regulatory 
trends through continuous personal knowledge 
building, internal training programmes and 
attending industry conferences and legal 
summits; (3) adopt AI-driven tools for monitoring 
legal developments to enhance efficiency and 
reduce manual workload.
Could you recommend a book that has particularly 
inspired you recently?
I’m not a huge fan of motivational/self-help books 
but I read Stanley Tucci’s ‘Taste’ recently and was 
deeply inspired by his ability to navigate through 
some really challenging life situations with the 
help of a healthy dose of dry humour sand his 
unwavering passion for good food and simple 
joys of life, something I can deeply relate to!
What is one piece of advice you have received 
throughout your career that continues to 
resonate with you?
My key takeaway from working in two of the 
largest and best law firms in the country is that the 
best way to approach any legal issue – whether 
as an external counsel or in-house counsel – is 
to be solution-oriented. Whilst as lawyers our 
primary job is to educate our clients on what is 
legally permissible or not, what ultimately creates 
long-lasting value is the ability to structure a 
practically feasible solution which is legally 
sound yet achieves the commercial objectives. It 
is important to avoid being reined in too much 
by what is ‘market standard’ and to be open 
to exploring unprecedented options so long as commercial position is not compromised and 
legal risks are avoided. I believe it is this ability 
which, in the long run, will set us apart from AI 
and keep the legal function relevant and critical 
in a rapidly changing world.
How do you manage to strike a balance between 
the demands of a high-pressure legal career and 
pursuing your personal passions like travel and 
social media?
By training the mind to (A) switch off from all 
work-relating thinking immediately once I step 
out of office; and (B) switch right back on if some 
urgent work assignment came up at odd times 
(which was frequently the case). It’s easier said 
than done, of course!
On a more serious note, I try to always clearly 
define priorities when it comes to work-life 
balance – the topmost one being physical health 
and mental wellbeing, as that ultimately and 
directly contributes to greater productivity and 
efficiency at work. It is so important to dedicate 
at least an hour a day entirely and without 
distractions to a focused exercise and meditation 
regime.
I also set personal goals based on my own 
capacity rather than comparing myself to others 
in the profession or being influenced by external 
expectations or judgement. This approach allows 
me to stay focused, fulfilled, and fully engaged 
in both my career and personal passions. It 
is important to treat recreational activities as 
contributing to personal growth and success as 
much as work/career related pursuits and not 
attach any sort of guilt or judgement to those.
To manage work stress, the best thing to do, in my 
opinion, is to break down and organise multiple 
work assignments, prioritise them according 
to client/employer expectations and then just 
deal with each of them one by one, working on 
steadily pushing each item off the plate. The 
attitude towards approaching a stressful work 
assignment is also crucial – an optimistic and 
solution-oriented approach to attacking a work 
assignment goes a long way.

In conversation with  
Madhuparna Dasgupta 
Director - Legal at Altico Advisors
The best way to approach any legal 
issue – whether as an external 
counsel or in-house counsel – is to 
be solution-oriented
- Madhuparna Dasgupta on the one piece of professional advice       
   that resonates with her.
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 2025 6
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 20257Please share your career progression following 
your tenure at Khaitan & Co. What motivated your 
transition to your current role as the Director - 
Legal at Altico Advisors?
I had recently been promoted to Partner at 
Khaitan & Co. when Altico approached me for 
a senior role in their legal team. At the same 
time, I had completed a decade in the law firm 
environment, dedicating myself to sustained 
vertical growth and establishing deep expertise 
in my practice area (Banking & Finance). Whilst 
I felt like I had achieved my personal goal of 
becoming a subject-matter expert, I saw this as 
the right opportunity to broaden my perspective 
and gain horizontal growth by diversifying 
my experience beyond a law firm setting. The 
transition to Altico allowed me to apply my law 
firm expertise in a new context while expanding 
my strategic and commercial acumen. Altico was 
also a client and I was familiar with their legal and 
investment teams and work ethic and this also 
helped with a smooth transition.
Based on your experience, how does working in 
a law firm environment differ from an in-house 
role?
The most apparent difference is that in a law firm 
you would be servicing multiple clients on specific 
assignments, typically requiring deep expertise in 
a particular field of law. Once you assume an in-
house legal role, your focus moves to providing 
legal support to a single organisation and 
handling a wide range of issues, from contracts 
and compliance to risk management and business 
strategy. Given that your involvement would go 
beyond completion of a legal mandate, there is 
a greater sense of ownership and a deeper and 
more practical understanding of the commercial 
objectives of a deal.
In your perspective, how do you foresee the role 
of legal counsel evolving in the coming years?
Traditionally, in-house legal teams were viewed 
as a cost center—a necessary but non-revenue-
generating function responsible for risk mitigation, 
compliance, and handling legal disputes. Legal 
teams often operating in silos, engaging with 
business functions only when required. Law 
firm associates would probably relate deeply to 
the frequent dilemma posed by ‘business team’ and ‘legal team’ comments appearing in drafts 
completely segregated and often at variance to 
each other! 
However, this perception has changed 
dramatically in recent years and I believe, will 
continue to evolve significantly in the coming 
years. General counsels are now frequently 
seen as business enablers and corporates have 
over time understood the importance and cost-
effectiveness of pre-emptive legal guidance at 
the inception or structuring stage of a deal rather 
than just legal risk vetting and damage control at 
an advanced stage. 
With this change in role and perspective towards 
an in-house counsel, the role of external legal 
counsel has also evolved significantly. Corporates 
would now expect external lawyers (steered with 
the help of in-house legal teams) to align their 
legal advice with business objectives and provide 
a holistic solution to legal issues, rather than 
restricting themselves to academic or theoretical 
responses; this expectation is also heightened 
in view of the recent advancements in AI and 
automated legal tech platforms and the external 
counsels would also need to keep abreast of 
these developments and leverage them to their 
advantage. 
Some key areas in my view where the role of 
external legal counsel is expected to evolve 
significantly are:
• Knowledge hubs: General counsels are 
increasingly relying on external legal advisors 
for providing real-time legal updates, thought 
leadership, and tailored regulatory insights. 
Firms that offer continuous knowledge 
management and legal foresight will stand 
out as indispensable partners in an evolving 
corporate landscape.
• Crisis management and risk mitigation: 
Corporate clients will increasingly turn to 
external counsel for crisis preparedness 
and response, particularly in areas like 
cybersecurity breaches, reputational risks, 
and regulatory investigations.
• Cross border expertise: As businesses expand 
into multiple jurisdictions, multinational 
corporations will demand lawyers whoAlumni in Focus 
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 20258
can navigate international trade laws, tax 
structures, and geopolitical risks, making global 
legal networks more valuable than ever.
What strategies do you implement to remain 
at the forefront of such a dynamic and ever-
changing industry?
Some key strategies would be to (1) communicate 
frequently with non-legal functions (investment, 
technical, HR, treasury) and participate actively 
in leadership discussions to gain an in-depth 
perspective of the commercials of a deal; (2) keep 
abreast of legal developments and regulatory 
trends through continuous personal knowledge 
building, internal training programmes and 
attending industry conferences and legal 
summits; (3) adopt AI-driven tools for monitoring 
legal developments to enhance efficiency and 
reduce manual workload.
Could you recommend a book that has particularly 
inspired you recently?
I’m not a huge fan of motivational/self-help books 
but I read Stanley Tucci’s ‘Taste’ recently and was 
deeply inspired by his ability to navigate through 
some really challenging life situations with the 
help of a healthy dose of dry humour sand his 
unwavering passion for good food and simple 
joys of life, something I can deeply relate to!
What is one piece of advice you have received 
throughout your career that continues to 
resonate with you?
My key takeaway from working in two of the 
largest and best law firms in the country is that the 
best way to approach any legal issue – whether 
as an external counsel or in-house counsel – is 
to be solution-oriented. Whilst as lawyers our 
primary job is to educate our clients on what is 
legally permissible or not, what ultimately creates 
long-lasting value is the ability to structure a 
practically feasible solution which is legally 
sound yet achieves the commercial objectives. It 
is important to avoid being reined in too much 
by what is ‘market standard’ and to be open 
to exploring unprecedented options so long as commercial position is not compromised and 
legal risks are avoided. I believe it is this ability 
which, in the long run, will set us apart from AI 
and keep the legal function relevant and critical 
in a rapidly changing world.
How do you manage to strike a balance between 
the demands of a high-pressure legal career and 
pursuing your personal passions like travel and 
social media?
By training the mind to (A) switch off from all 
work-relating thinking immediately once I step 
out of office; and (B) switch right back on if some 
urgent work assignment came up at odd times 
(which was frequently the case). It’s easier said 
than done, of course!
On a more serious note, I try to always clearly 
define priorities when it comes to work-life 
balance – the topmost one being physical health 
and mental wellbeing, as that ultimately and 
directly contributes to greater productivity and 
efficiency at work. It is so important to dedicate 
at least an hour a day entirely and without 
distractions to a focused exercise and meditation 
regime.
I also set personal goals based on my own 
capacity rather than comparing myself to others 
in the profession or being influenced by external 
expectations or judgement. This approach allows 
me to stay focused, fulfilled, and fully engaged 
in both my career and personal passions. It 
is important to treat recreational activities as 
contributing to personal growth and success as 
much as work/career related pursuits and not 
attach any sort of guilt or judgement to those.
To manage work stress, the best thing to do, in my 
opinion, is to break down and organise multiple 
work assignments, prioritise them according 
to client/employer expectations and then just 
deal with each of them one by one, working on 
steadily pushing each item off the plate. The 
attitude towards approaching a stressful work 
assignment is also crucial – an optimistic and 
solution-oriented approach to attacking a work 
assignment goes a long way.

In conversation with  
Madhuparna Dasgupta 
Director - Legal at Altico Advisors
The best way to approach any legal 
issue – whether as an external 
counsel or in-house counsel – is to 
be solution-oriented
- Madhuparna Dasgupta on the one piece of professional advice       
   that resonates with her.
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 2025 6
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 20257Please share your career progression following 
your tenure at Khaitan & Co. What motivated your 
transition to your current role as the Director - 
Legal at Altico Advisors?
I had recently been promoted to Partner at 
Khaitan & Co. when Altico approached me for 
a senior role in their legal team. At the same 
time, I had completed a decade in the law firm 
environment, dedicating myself to sustained 
vertical growth and establishing deep expertise 
in my practice area (Banking & Finance). Whilst 
I felt like I had achieved my personal goal of 
becoming a subject-matter expert, I saw this as 
the right opportunity to broaden my perspective 
and gain horizontal growth by diversifying 
my experience beyond a law firm setting. The 
transition to Altico allowed me to apply my law 
firm expertise in a new context while expanding 
my strategic and commercial acumen. Altico was 
also a client and I was familiar with their legal and 
investment teams and work ethic and this also 
helped with a smooth transition.
Based on your experience, how does working in 
a law firm environment differ from an in-house 
role?
The most apparent difference is that in a law firm 
you would be servicing multiple clients on specific 
assignments, typically requiring deep expertise in 
a particular field of law. Once you assume an in-
house legal role, your focus moves to providing 
legal support to a single organisation and 
handling a wide range of issues, from contracts 
and compliance to risk management and business 
strategy. Given that your involvement would go 
beyond completion of a legal mandate, there is 
a greater sense of ownership and a deeper and 
more practical understanding of the commercial 
objectives of a deal.
In your perspective, how do you foresee the role 
of legal counsel evolving in the coming years?
Traditionally, in-house legal teams were viewed 
as a cost center—a necessary but non-revenue-
generating function responsible for risk mitigation, 
compliance, and handling legal disputes. Legal 
teams often operating in silos, engaging with 
business functions only when required. Law 
firm associates would probably relate deeply to 
the frequent dilemma posed by ‘business team’ and ‘legal team’ comments appearing in drafts 
completely segregated and often at variance to 
each other! 
However, this perception has changed 
dramatically in recent years and I believe, will 
continue to evolve significantly in the coming 
years. General counsels are now frequently 
seen as business enablers and corporates have 
over time understood the importance and cost-
effectiveness of pre-emptive legal guidance at 
the inception or structuring stage of a deal rather 
than just legal risk vetting and damage control at 
an advanced stage. 
With this change in role and perspective towards 
an in-house counsel, the role of external legal 
counsel has also evolved significantly. Corporates 
would now expect external lawyers (steered with 
the help of in-house legal teams) to align their 
legal advice with business objectives and provide 
a holistic solution to legal issues, rather than 
restricting themselves to academic or theoretical 
responses; this expectation is also heightened 
in view of the recent advancements in AI and 
automated legal tech platforms and the external 
counsels would also need to keep abreast of 
these developments and leverage them to their 
advantage. 
Some key areas in my view where the role of 
external legal counsel is expected to evolve 
significantly are:
• Knowledge hubs: General counsels are 
increasingly relying on external legal advisors 
for providing real-time legal updates, thought 
leadership, and tailored regulatory insights. 
Firms that offer continuous knowledge 
management and legal foresight will stand 
out as indispensable partners in an evolving 
corporate landscape.
• Crisis management and risk mitigation: 
Corporate clients will increasingly turn to 
external counsel for crisis preparedness 
and response, particularly in areas like 
cybersecurity breaches, reputational risks, 
and regulatory investigations.
• Cross border expertise: As businesses expand 
into multiple jurisdictions, multinational 
corporations will demand lawyers whoAlumni in Focus 
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 20258
can navigate international trade laws, tax 
structures, and geopolitical risks, making global 
legal networks more valuable than ever.
What strategies do you implement to remain 
at the forefront of such a dynamic and ever-
changing industry?
Some key strategies would be to (1) communicate 
frequently with non-legal functions (investment, 
technical, HR, treasury) and participate actively 
in leadership discussions to gain an in-depth 
perspective of the commercials of a deal; (2) keep 
abreast of legal developments and regulatory 
trends through continuous personal knowledge 
building, internal training programmes and 
attending industry conferences and legal 
summits; (3) adopt AI-driven tools for monitoring 
legal developments to enhance efficiency and 
reduce manual workload.
Could you recommend a book that has particularly 
inspired you recently?
I’m not a huge fan of motivational/self-help books 
but I read Stanley Tucci’s ‘Taste’ recently and was 
deeply inspired by his ability to navigate through 
some really challenging life situations with the 
help of a healthy dose of dry humour sand his 
unwavering passion for good food and simple 
joys of life, something I can deeply relate to!
What is one piece of advice you have received 
throughout your career that continues to 
resonate with you?
My key takeaway from working in two of the 
largest and best law firms in the country is that the 
best way to approach any legal issue – whether 
as an external counsel or in-house counsel – is 
to be solution-oriented. Whilst as lawyers our 
primary job is to educate our clients on what is 
legally permissible or not, what ultimately creates 
long-lasting value is the ability to structure a 
practically feasible solution which is legally 
sound yet achieves the commercial objectives. It 
is important to avoid being reined in too much 
by what is ‘market standard’ and to be open 
to exploring unprecedented options so long as commercial position is not compromised and 
legal risks are avoided. I believe it is this ability 
which, in the long run, will set us apart from AI 
and keep the legal function relevant and critical 
in a rapidly changing world.
How do you manage to strike a balance between 
the demands of a high-pressure legal career and 
pursuing your personal passions like travel and 
social media?
By training the mind to (A) switch off from all 
work-relating thinking immediately once I step 
out of office; and (B) switch right back on if some 
urgent work assignment came up at odd times 
(which was frequently the case). It’s easier said 
than done, of course!
On a more serious note, I try to always clearly 
define priorities when it comes to work-life 
balance – the topmost one being physical health 
and mental wellbeing, as that ultimately and 
directly contributes to greater productivity and 
efficiency at work. It is so important to dedicate 
at least an hour a day entirely and without 
distractions to a focused exercise and meditation 
regime.
I also set personal goals based on my own 
capacity rather than comparing myself to others 
in the profession or being influenced by external 
expectations or judgement. This approach allows 
me to stay focused, fulfilled, and fully engaged 
in both my career and personal passions. It 
is important to treat recreational activities as 
contributing to personal growth and success as 
much as work/career related pursuits and not 
attach any sort of guilt or judgement to those.
To manage work stress, the best thing to do, in my 
opinion, is to break down and organise multiple 
work assignments, prioritise them according 
to client/employer expectations and then just 
deal with each of them one by one, working on 
steadily pushing each item off the plate. The 
attitude towards approaching a stressful work 
assignment is also crucial – an optimistic and 
solution-oriented approach to attacking a work 
assignment goes a long way.

In conversation with  
Madhuparna Dasgupta 
Director - Legal at Altico Advisors
The best way to approach any legal 
issue – whether as an external 
counsel or in-house counsel – is to 
be solution-oriented
- Madhuparna Dasgupta on the one piece of professional advice       
   that resonates with her.
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 2025 6
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 20257Please share your career progression following 
your tenure at Khaitan & Co. What motivated your 
transition to your current role as the Director - 
Legal at Altico Advisors?
I had recently been promoted to Partner at 
Khaitan & Co. when Altico approached me for 
a senior role in their legal team. At the same 
time, I had completed a decade in the law firm 
environment, dedicating myself to sustained 
vertical growth and establishing deep expertise 
in my practice area (Banking & Finance). Whilst 
I felt like I had achieved my personal goal of 
becoming a subject-matter expert, I saw this as 
the right opportunity to broaden my perspective 
and gain horizontal growth by diversifying 
my experience beyond a law firm setting. The 
transition to Altico allowed me to apply my law 
firm expertise in a new context while expanding 
my strategic and commercial acumen. Altico was 
also a client and I was familiar with their legal and 
investment teams and work ethic and this also 
helped with a smooth transition.
Based on your experience, how does working in 
a law firm environment differ from an in-house 
role?
The most apparent difference is that in a law firm 
you would be servicing multiple clients on specific 
assignments, typically requiring deep expertise in 
a particular field of law. Once you assume an in-
house legal role, your focus moves to providing 
legal support to a single organisation and 
handling a wide range of issues, from contracts 
and compliance to risk management and business 
strategy. Given that your involvement would go 
beyond completion of a legal mandate, there is 
a greater sense of ownership and a deeper and 
more practical understanding of the commercial 
objectives of a deal.
In your perspective, how do you foresee the role 
of legal counsel evolving in the coming years?
Traditionally, in-house legal teams were viewed 
as a cost center—a necessary but non-revenue-
generating function responsible for risk mitigation, 
compliance, and handling legal disputes. Legal 
teams often operating in silos, engaging with 
business functions only when required. Law 
firm associates would probably relate deeply to 
the frequent dilemma posed by ‘business team’ and ‘legal team’ comments appearing in drafts 
completely segregated and often at variance to 
each other! 
However, this perception has changed 
dramatically in recent years and I believe, will 
continue to evolve significantly in the coming 
years. General counsels are now frequently 
seen as business enablers and corporates have 
over time understood the importance and cost-
effectiveness of pre-emptive legal guidance at 
the inception or structuring stage of a deal rather 
than just legal risk vetting and damage control at 
an advanced stage. 
With this change in role and perspective towards 
an in-house counsel, the role of external legal 
counsel has also evolved significantly. Corporates 
would now expect external lawyers (steered with 
the help of in-house legal teams) to align their 
legal advice with business objectives and provide 
a holistic solution to legal issues, rather than 
restricting themselves to academic or theoretical 
responses; this expectation is also heightened 
in view of the recent advancements in AI and 
automated legal tech platforms and the external 
counsels would also need to keep abreast of 
these developments and leverage them to their 
advantage. 
Some key areas in my view where the role of 
external legal counsel is expected to evolve 
significantly are:
• Knowledge hubs: General counsels are 
increasingly relying on external legal advisors 
for providing real-time legal updates, thought 
leadership, and tailored regulatory insights. 
Firms that offer continuous knowledge 
management and legal foresight will stand 
out as indispensable partners in an evolving 
corporate landscape.
• Crisis management and risk mitigation: 
Corporate clients will increasingly turn to 
external counsel for crisis preparedness 
and response, particularly in areas like 
cybersecurity breaches, reputational risks, 
and regulatory investigations.
• Cross border expertise: As businesses expand 
into multiple jurisdictions, multinational 
corporations will demand lawyers whoAlumni in Focus 
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 20258
can navigate international trade laws, tax 
structures, and geopolitical risks, making global 
legal networks more valuable than ever.
What strategies do you implement to remain 
at the forefront of such a dynamic and ever-
changing industry?
Some key strategies would be to (1) communicate 
frequently with non-legal functions (investment, 
technical, HR, treasury) and participate actively 
in leadership discussions to gain an in-depth 
perspective of the commercials of a deal; (2) keep 
abreast of legal developments and regulatory 
trends through continuous personal knowledge 
building, internal training programmes and 
attending industry conferences and legal 
summits; (3) adopt AI-driven tools for monitoring 
legal developments to enhance efficiency and 
reduce manual workload.
Could you recommend a book that has particularly 
inspired you recently?
I’m not a huge fan of motivational/self-help books 
but I read Stanley Tucci’s ‘Taste’ recently and was 
deeply inspired by his ability to navigate through 
some really challenging life situations with the 
help of a healthy dose of dry humour sand his 
unwavering passion for good food and simple 
joys of life, something I can deeply relate to!
What is one piece of advice you have received 
throughout your career that continues to 
resonate with you?
My key takeaway from working in two of the 
largest and best law firms in the country is that the 
best way to approach any legal issue – whether 
as an external counsel or in-house counsel – is 
to be solution-oriented. Whilst as lawyers our 
primary job is to educate our clients on what is 
legally permissible or not, what ultimately creates 
long-lasting value is the ability to structure a 
practically feasible solution which is legally 
sound yet achieves the commercial objectives. It 
is important to avoid being reined in too much 
by what is ‘market standard’ and to be open 
to exploring unprecedented options so long as commercial position is not compromised and 
legal risks are avoided. I believe it is this ability 
which, in the long run, will set us apart from AI 
and keep the legal function relevant and critical 
in a rapidly changing world.
How do you manage to strike a balance between 
the demands of a high-pressure legal career and 
pursuing your personal passions like travel and 
social media?
By training the mind to (A) switch off from all 
work-relating thinking immediately once I step 
out of office; and (B) switch right back on if some 
urgent work assignment came up at odd times 
(which was frequently the case). It’s easier said 
than done, of course!
On a more serious note, I try to always clearly 
define priorities when it comes to work-life 
balance – the topmost one being physical health 
and mental wellbeing, as that ultimately and 
directly contributes to greater productivity and 
efficiency at work. It is so important to dedicate 
at least an hour a day entirely and without 
distractions to a focused exercise and meditation 
regime.
I also set personal goals based on my own 
capacity rather than comparing myself to others 
in the profession or being influenced by external 
expectations or judgement. This approach allows 
me to stay focused, fulfilled, and fully engaged 
in both my career and personal passions. It 
is important to treat recreational activities as 
contributing to personal growth and success as 
much as work/career related pursuits and not 
attach any sort of guilt or judgement to those.
To manage work stress, the best thing to do, in my 
opinion, is to break down and organise multiple 
work assignments, prioritise them according 
to client/employer expectations and then just 
deal with each of them one by one, working on 
steadily pushing each item off the plate. The 
attitude towards approaching a stressful work 
assignment is also crucial – an optimistic and 
solution-oriented approach to attacking a work 
assignment goes a long way.

In conversation with  
Madhuparna Dasgupta 
Director - Legal at Altico Advisors
The best way to approach any legal 
issue – whether as an external 
counsel or in-house counsel – is to 
be solution-oriented
- Madhuparna Dasgupta on the one piece of professional advice       
   that resonates with her.
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 2025 6
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 20257Please share your career progression following 
your tenure at Khaitan & Co. What motivated your 
transition to your current role as the Director - 
Legal at Altico Advisors?
I had recently been promoted to Partner at 
Khaitan & Co. when Altico approached me for 
a senior role in their legal team. At the same 
time, I had completed a decade in the law firm 
environment, dedicating myself to sustained 
vertical growth and establishing deep expertise 
in my practice area (Banking & Finance). Whilst 
I felt like I had achieved my personal goal of 
becoming a subject-matter expert, I saw this as 
the right opportunity to broaden my perspective 
and gain horizontal growth by diversifying 
my experience beyond a law firm setting. The 
transition to Altico allowed me to apply my law 
firm expertise in a new context while expanding 
my strategic and commercial acumen. Altico was 
also a client and I was familiar with their legal and 
investment teams and work ethic and this also 
helped with a smooth transition.
Based on your experience, how does working in 
a law firm environment differ from an in-house 
role?
The most apparent difference is that in a law firm 
you would be servicing multiple clients on specific 
assignments, typically requiring deep expertise in 
a particular field of law. Once you assume an in-
house legal role, your focus moves to providing 
legal support to a single organisation and 
handling a wide range of issues, from contracts 
and compliance to risk management and business 
strategy. Given that your involvement would go 
beyond completion of a legal mandate, there is 
a greater sense of ownership and a deeper and 
more practical understanding of the commercial 
objectives of a deal.
In your perspective, how do you foresee the role 
of legal counsel evolving in the coming years?
Traditionally, in-house legal teams were viewed 
as a cost center—a necessary but non-revenue-
generating function responsible for risk mitigation, 
compliance, and handling legal disputes. Legal 
teams often operating in silos, engaging with 
business functions only when required. Law 
firm associates would probably relate deeply to 
the frequent dilemma posed by ‘business team’ and ‘legal team’ comments appearing in drafts 
completely segregated and often at variance to 
each other! 
However, this perception has changed 
dramatically in recent years and I believe, will 
continue to evolve significantly in the coming 
years. General counsels are now frequently 
seen as business enablers and corporates have 
over time understood the importance and cost-
effectiveness of pre-emptive legal guidance at 
the inception or structuring stage of a deal rather 
than just legal risk vetting and damage control at 
an advanced stage. 
With this change in role and perspective towards 
an in-house counsel, the role of external legal 
counsel has also evolved significantly. Corporates 
would now expect external lawyers (steered with 
the help of in-house legal teams) to align their 
legal advice with business objectives and provide 
a holistic solution to legal issues, rather than 
restricting themselves to academic or theoretical 
responses; this expectation is also heightened 
in view of the recent advancements in AI and 
automated legal tech platforms and the external 
counsels would also need to keep abreast of 
these developments and leverage them to their 
advantage. 
Some key areas in my view where the role of 
external legal counsel is expected to evolve 
significantly are:
• Knowledge hubs: General counsels are 
increasingly relying on external legal advisors 
for providing real-time legal updates, thought 
leadership, and tailored regulatory insights. 
Firms that offer continuous knowledge 
management and legal foresight will stand 
out as indispensable partners in an evolving 
corporate landscape.
• Crisis management and risk mitigation: 
Corporate clients will increasingly turn to 
external counsel for crisis preparedness 
and response, particularly in areas like 
cybersecurity breaches, reputational risks, 
and regulatory investigations.
• Cross border expertise: As businesses expand 
into multiple jurisdictions, multinational 
corporations will demand lawyers whoAlumni in Focus 
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 20258
can navigate international trade laws, tax 
structures, and geopolitical risks, making global 
legal networks more valuable than ever.
What strategies do you implement to remain 
at the forefront of such a dynamic and ever-
changing industry?
Some key strategies would be to (1) communicate 
frequently with non-legal functions (investment, 
technical, HR, treasury) and participate actively 
in leadership discussions to gain an in-depth 
perspective of the commercials of a deal; (2) keep 
abreast of legal developments and regulatory 
trends through continuous personal knowledge 
building, internal training programmes and 
attending industry conferences and legal 
summits; (3) adopt AI-driven tools for monitoring 
legal developments to enhance efficiency and 
reduce manual workload.
Could you recommend a book that has particularly 
inspired you recently?
I’m not a huge fan of motivational/self-help books 
but I read Stanley Tucci’s ‘Taste’ recently and was 
deeply inspired by his ability to navigate through 
some really challenging life situations with the 
help of a healthy dose of dry humour sand his 
unwavering passion for good food and simple 
joys of life, something I can deeply relate to!
What is one piece of advice you have received 
throughout your career that continues to 
resonate with you?
My key takeaway from working in two of the 
largest and best law firms in the country is that the 
best way to approach any legal issue – whether 
as an external counsel or in-house counsel – is 
to be solution-oriented. Whilst as lawyers our 
primary job is to educate our clients on what is 
legally permissible or not, what ultimately creates 
long-lasting value is the ability to structure a 
practically feasible solution which is legally 
sound yet achieves the commercial objectives. It 
is important to avoid being reined in too much 
by what is ‘market standard’ and to be open 
to exploring unprecedented options so long as commercial position is not compromised and 
legal risks are avoided. I believe it is this ability 
which, in the long run, will set us apart from AI 
and keep the legal function relevant and critical 
in a rapidly changing world.
How do you manage to strike a balance between 
the demands of a high-pressure legal career and 
pursuing your personal passions like travel and 
social media?
By training the mind to (A) switch off from all 
work-relating thinking immediately once I step 
out of office; and (B) switch right back on if some 
urgent work assignment came up at odd times 
(which was frequently the case). It’s easier said 
than done, of course!
On a more serious note, I try to always clearly 
define priorities when it comes to work-life 
balance – the topmost one being physical health 
and mental wellbeing, as that ultimately and 
directly contributes to greater productivity and 
efficiency at work. It is so important to dedicate 
at least an hour a day entirely and without 
distractions to a focused exercise and meditation 
regime.
I also set personal goals based on my own 
capacity rather than comparing myself to others 
in the profession or being influenced by external 
expectations or judgement. This approach allows 
me to stay focused, fulfilled, and fully engaged 
in both my career and personal passions. It 
is important to treat recreational activities as 
contributing to personal growth and success as 
much as work/career related pursuits and not 
attach any sort of guilt or judgement to those.
To manage work stress, the best thing to do, in my 
opinion, is to break down and organise multiple 
work assignments, prioritise them according 
to client/employer expectations and then just 
deal with each of them one by one, working on 
steadily pushing each item off the plate. The 
attitude towards approaching a stressful work 
assignment is also crucial – an optimistic and 
solution-oriented approach to attacking a work 
assignment goes a long way.

In conversation with  
Madhuparna Dasgupta 
Director - Legal at Altico Advisors
The best way to approach any legal 
issue – whether as an external 
counsel or in-house counsel – is to 
be solution-oriented
- Madhuparna Dasgupta on the one piece of professional advice       
   that resonates with her.
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 2025 6
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 20257Please share your career progression following 
your tenure at Khaitan & Co. What motivated your 
transition to your current role as the Director - 
Legal at Altico Advisors?
I had recently been promoted to Partner at 
Khaitan & Co. when Altico approached me for 
a senior role in their legal team. At the same 
time, I had completed a decade in the law firm 
environment, dedicating myself to sustained 
vertical growth and establishing deep expertise 
in my practice area (Banking & Finance). Whilst 
I felt like I had achieved my personal goal of 
becoming a subject-matter expert, I saw this as 
the right opportunity to broaden my perspective 
and gain horizontal growth by diversifying 
my experience beyond a law firm setting. The 
transition to Altico allowed me to apply my law 
firm expertise in a new context while expanding 
my strategic and commercial acumen. Altico was 
also a client and I was familiar with their legal and 
investment teams and work ethic and this also 
helped with a smooth transition.
Based on your experience, how does working in 
a law firm environment differ from an in-house 
role?
The most apparent difference is that in a law firm 
you would be servicing multiple clients on specific 
assignments, typically requiring deep expertise in 
a particular field of law. Once you assume an in-
house legal role, your focus moves to providing 
legal support to a single organisation and 
handling a wide range of issues, from contracts 
and compliance to risk management and business 
strategy. Given that your involvement would go 
beyond completion of a legal mandate, there is 
a greater sense of ownership and a deeper and 
more practical understanding of the commercial 
objectives of a deal.
In your perspective, how do you foresee the role 
of legal counsel evolving in the coming years?
Traditionally, in-house legal teams were viewed 
as a cost center—a necessary but non-revenue-
generating function responsible for risk mitigation, 
compliance, and handling legal disputes. Legal 
teams often operating in silos, engaging with 
business functions only when required. Law 
firm associates would probably relate deeply to 
the frequent dilemma posed by ‘business team’ and ‘legal team’ comments appearing in drafts 
completely segregated and often at variance to 
each other! 
However, this perception has changed 
dramatically in recent years and I believe, will 
continue to evolve significantly in the coming 
years. General counsels are now frequently 
seen as business enablers and corporates have 
over time understood the importance and cost-
effectiveness of pre-emptive legal guidance at 
the inception or structuring stage of a deal rather 
than just legal risk vetting and damage control at 
an advanced stage. 
With this change in role and perspective towards 
an in-house counsel, the role of external legal 
counsel has also evolved significantly. Corporates 
would now expect external lawyers (steered with 
the help of in-house legal teams) to align their 
legal advice with business objectives and provide 
a holistic solution to legal issues, rather than 
restricting themselves to academic or theoretical 
responses; this expectation is also heightened 
in view of the recent advancements in AI and 
automated legal tech platforms and the external 
counsels would also need to keep abreast of 
these developments and leverage them to their 
advantage. 
Some key areas in my view where the role of 
external legal counsel is expected to evolve 
significantly are:
• Knowledge hubs: General counsels are 
increasingly relying on external legal advisors 
for providing real-time legal updates, thought 
leadership, and tailored regulatory insights. 
Firms that offer continuous knowledge 
management and legal foresight will stand 
out as indispensable partners in an evolving 
corporate landscape.
• Crisis management and risk mitigation: 
Corporate clients will increasingly turn to 
external counsel for crisis preparedness 
and response, particularly in areas like 
cybersecurity breaches, reputational risks, 
and regulatory investigations.
• Cross border expertise: As businesses expand 
into multiple jurisdictions, multinational 
corporations will demand lawyers whoAlumni in Focus 
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 20258
can navigate international trade laws, tax 
structures, and geopolitical risks, making global 
legal networks more valuable than ever.
What strategies do you implement to remain 
at the forefront of such a dynamic and ever-
changing industry?
Some key strategies would be to (1) communicate 
frequently with non-legal functions (investment, 
technical, HR, treasury) and participate actively 
in leadership discussions to gain an in-depth 
perspective of the commercials of a deal; (2) keep 
abreast of legal developments and regulatory 
trends through continuous personal knowledge 
building, internal training programmes and 
attending industry conferences and legal 
summits; (3) adopt AI-driven tools for monitoring 
legal developments to enhance efficiency and 
reduce manual workload.
Could you recommend a book that has particularly 
inspired you recently?
I’m not a huge fan of motivational/self-help books 
but I read Stanley Tucci’s ‘Taste’ recently and was 
deeply inspired by his ability to navigate through 
some really challenging life situations with the 
help of a healthy dose of dry humour sand his 
unwavering passion for good food and simple 
joys of life, something I can deeply relate to!
What is one piece of advice you have received 
throughout your career that continues to 
resonate with you?
My key takeaway from working in two of the 
largest and best law firms in the country is that the 
best way to approach any legal issue – whether 
as an external counsel or in-house counsel – is 
to be solution-oriented. Whilst as lawyers our 
primary job is to educate our clients on what is 
legally permissible or not, what ultimately creates 
long-lasting value is the ability to structure a 
practically feasible solution which is legally 
sound yet achieves the commercial objectives. It 
is important to avoid being reined in too much 
by what is ‘market standard’ and to be open 
to exploring unprecedented options so long as commercial position is not compromised and 
legal risks are avoided. I believe it is this ability 
which, in the long run, will set us apart from AI 
and keep the legal function relevant and critical 
in a rapidly changing world.
How do you manage to strike a balance between 
the demands of a high-pressure legal career and 
pursuing your personal passions like travel and 
social media?
By training the mind to (A) switch off from all 
work-relating thinking immediately once I step 
out of office; and (B) switch right back on if some 
urgent work assignment came up at odd times 
(which was frequently the case). It’s easier said 
than done, of course!
On a more serious note, I try to always clearly 
define priorities when it comes to work-life 
balance – the topmost one being physical health 
and mental wellbeing, as that ultimately and 
directly contributes to greater productivity and 
efficiency at work. It is so important to dedicate 
at least an hour a day entirely and without 
distractions to a focused exercise and meditation 
regime.
I also set personal goals based on my own 
capacity rather than comparing myself to others 
in the profession or being influenced by external 
expectations or judgement. This approach allows 
me to stay focused, fulfilled, and fully engaged 
in both my career and personal passions. It 
is important to treat recreational activities as 
contributing to personal growth and success as 
much as work/career related pursuits and not 
attach any sort of guilt or judgement to those.
To manage work stress, the best thing to do, in my 
opinion, is to break down and organise multiple 
work assignments, prioritise them according 
to client/employer expectations and then just 
deal with each of them one by one, working on 
steadily pushing each item off the plate. The 
attitude towards approaching a stressful work 
assignment is also crucial – an optimistic and 
solution-oriented approach to attacking a work 
assignment goes a long way.

In conversation with  
Madhuparna Dasgupta 
Director - Legal at Altico Advisors
The best way to approach any legal 
issue – whether as an external 
counsel or in-house counsel – is to 
be solution-oriented
- Madhuparna Dasgupta on the one piece of professional advice       
   that resonates with her.
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 2025 6
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 20257Please share your career progression following 
your tenure at Khaitan & Co. What motivated your 
transition to your current role as the Director - 
Legal at Altico Advisors?
I had recently been promoted to Partner at 
Khaitan & Co. when Altico approached me for 
a senior role in their legal team. At the same 
time, I had completed a decade in the law firm 
environment, dedicating myself to sustained 
vertical growth and establishing deep expertise 
in my practice area (Banking & Finance). Whilst 
I felt like I had achieved my personal goal of 
becoming a subject-matter expert, I saw this as 
the right opportunity to broaden my perspective 
and gain horizontal growth by diversifying 
my experience beyond a law firm setting. The 
transition to Altico allowed me to apply my law 
firm expertise in a new context while expanding 
my strategic and commercial acumen. Altico was 
also a client and I was familiar with their legal and 
investment teams and work ethic and this also 
helped with a smooth transition.
Based on your experience, how does working in 
a law firm environment differ from an in-house 
role?
The most apparent difference is that in a law firm 
you would be servicing multiple clients on specific 
assignments, typically requiring deep expertise in 
a particular field of law. Once you assume an in-
house legal role, your focus moves to providing 
legal support to a single organisation and 
handling a wide range of issues, from contracts 
and compliance to risk management and business 
strategy. Given that your involvement would go 
beyond completion of a legal mandate, there is 
a greater sense of ownership and a deeper and 
more practical understanding of the commercial 
objectives of a deal.
In your perspective, how do you foresee the role 
of legal counsel evolving in the coming years?
Traditionally, in-house legal teams were viewed 
as a cost center—a necessary but non-revenue-
generating function responsible for risk mitigation, 
compliance, and handling legal disputes. Legal 
teams often operating in silos, engaging with 
business functions only when required. Law 
firm associates would probably relate deeply to 
the frequent dilemma posed by ‘business team’ and ‘legal team’ comments appearing in drafts 
completely segregated and often at variance to 
each other! 
However, this perception has changed 
dramatically in recent years and I believe, will 
continue to evolve significantly in the coming 
years. General counsels are now frequently 
seen as business enablers and corporates have 
over time understood the importance and cost-
effectiveness of pre-emptive legal guidance at 
the inception or structuring stage of a deal rather 
than just legal risk vetting and damage control at 
an advanced stage. 
With this change in role and perspective towards 
an in-house counsel, the role of external legal 
counsel has also evolved significantly. Corporates 
would now expect external lawyers (steered with 
the help of in-house legal teams) to align their 
legal advice with business objectives and provide 
a holistic solution to legal issues, rather than 
restricting themselves to academic or theoretical 
responses; this expectation is also heightened 
in view of the recent advancements in AI and 
automated legal tech platforms and the external 
counsels would also need to keep abreast of 
these developments and leverage them to their 
advantage. 
Some key areas in my view where the role of 
external legal counsel is expected to evolve 
significantly are:
• Knowledge hubs: General counsels are 
increasingly relying on external legal advisors 
for providing real-time legal updates, thought 
leadership, and tailored regulatory insights. 
Firms that offer continuous knowledge 
management and legal foresight will stand 
out as indispensable partners in an evolving 
corporate landscape.
• Crisis management and risk mitigation: 
Corporate clients will increasingly turn to 
external counsel for crisis preparedness 
and response, particularly in areas like 
cybersecurity breaches, reputational risks, 
and regulatory investigations.
• Cross border expertise: As businesses expand 
into multiple jurisdictions, multinational 
corporations will demand lawyers whoAlumni in Focus 
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 20258
can navigate international trade laws, tax 
structures, and geopolitical risks, making global 
legal networks more valuable than ever.
What strategies do you implement to remain 
at the forefront of such a dynamic and ever-
changing industry?
Some key strategies would be to (1) communicate 
frequently with non-legal functions (investment, 
technical, HR, treasury) and participate actively 
in leadership discussions to gain an in-depth 
perspective of the commercials of a deal; (2) keep 
abreast of legal developments and regulatory 
trends through continuous personal knowledge 
building, internal training programmes and 
attending industry conferences and legal 
summits; (3) adopt AI-driven tools for monitoring 
legal developments to enhance efficiency and 
reduce manual workload.
Could you recommend a book that has particularly 
inspired you recently?
I’m not a huge fan of motivational/self-help books 
but I read Stanley Tucci’s ‘Taste’ recently and was 
deeply inspired by his ability to navigate through 
some really challenging life situations with the 
help of a healthy dose of dry humour sand his 
unwavering passion for good food and simple 
joys of life, something I can deeply relate to!
What is one piece of advice you have received 
throughout your career that continues to 
resonate with you?
My key takeaway from working in two of the 
largest and best law firms in the country is that the 
best way to approach any legal issue – whether 
as an external counsel or in-house counsel – is 
to be solution-oriented. Whilst as lawyers our 
primary job is to educate our clients on what is 
legally permissible or not, what ultimately creates 
long-lasting value is the ability to structure a 
practically feasible solution which is legally 
sound yet achieves the commercial objectives. It 
is important to avoid being reined in too much 
by what is ‘market standard’ and to be open 
to exploring unprecedented options so long as commercial position is not compromised and 
legal risks are avoided. I believe it is this ability 
which, in the long run, will set us apart from AI 
and keep the legal function relevant and critical 
in a rapidly changing world.
How do you manage to strike a balance between 
the demands of a high-pressure legal career and 
pursuing your personal passions like travel and 
social media?
By training the mind to (A) switch off from all 
work-relating thinking immediately once I step 
out of office; and (B) switch right back on if some 
urgent work assignment came up at odd times 
(which was frequently the case). It’s easier said 
than done, of course!
On a more serious note, I try to always clearly 
define priorities when it comes to work-life 
balance – the topmost one being physical health 
and mental wellbeing, as that ultimately and 
directly contributes to greater productivity and 
efficiency at work. It is so important to dedicate 
at least an hour a day entirely and without 
distractions to a focused exercise and meditation 
regime.
I also set personal goals based on my own 
capacity rather than comparing myself to others 
in the profession or being influenced by external 
expectations or judgement. This approach allows 
me to stay focused, fulfilled, and fully engaged 
in both my career and personal passions. It 
is important to treat recreational activities as 
contributing to personal growth and success as 
much as work/career related pursuits and not 
attach any sort of guilt or judgement to those.
To manage work stress, the best thing to do, in my 
opinion, is to break down and organise multiple 
work assignments, prioritise them according 
to client/employer expectations and then just 
deal with each of them one by one, working on 
steadily pushing each item off the plate. The 
attitude towards approaching a stressful work 
assignment is also crucial – an optimistic and 
solution-oriented approach to attacking a work 
assignment goes a long way.

In conversation with  
Madhuparna Dasgupta 
Director - Legal at Altico Advisors
The best way to approach any legal 
issue – whether as an external 
counsel or in-house counsel – is to 
be solution-oriented
- Madhuparna Dasgupta on the one piece of professional advice       
   that resonates with her.
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 2025 6
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 20257Please share your career progression following 
your tenure at Khaitan & Co. What motivated your 
transition to your current role as the Director - 
Legal at Altico Advisors?
I had recently been promoted to Partner at 
Khaitan & Co. when Altico approached me for 
a senior role in their legal team. At the same 
time, I had completed a decade in the law firm 
environment, dedicating myself to sustained 
vertical growth and establishing deep expertise 
in my practice area (Banking & Finance). Whilst 
I felt like I had achieved my personal goal of 
becoming a subject-matter expert, I saw this as 
the right opportunity to broaden my perspective 
and gain horizontal growth by diversifying 
my experience beyond a law firm setting. The 
transition to Altico allowed me to apply my law 
firm expertise in a new context while expanding 
my strategic and commercial acumen. Altico was 
also a client and I was familiar with their legal and 
investment teams and work ethic and this also 
helped with a smooth transition.
Based on your experience, how does working in 
a law firm environment differ from an in-house 
role?
The most apparent difference is that in a law firm 
you would be servicing multiple clients on specific 
assignments, typically requiring deep expertise in 
a particular field of law. Once you assume an in-
house legal role, your focus moves to providing 
legal support to a single organisation and 
handling a wide range of issues, from contracts 
and compliance to risk management and business 
strategy. Given that your involvement would go 
beyond completion of a legal mandate, there is 
a greater sense of ownership and a deeper and 
more practical understanding of the commercial 
objectives of a deal.
In your perspective, how do you foresee the role 
of legal counsel evolving in the coming years?
Traditionally, in-house legal teams were viewed 
as a cost center—a necessary but non-revenue-
generating function responsible for risk mitigation, 
compliance, and handling legal disputes. Legal 
teams often operating in silos, engaging with 
business functions only when required. Law 
firm associates would probably relate deeply to 
the frequent dilemma posed by ‘business team’ and ‘legal team’ comments appearing in drafts 
completely segregated and often at variance to 
each other! 
However, this perception has changed 
dramatically in recent years and I believe, will 
continue to evolve significantly in the coming 
years. General counsels are now frequently 
seen as business enablers and corporates have 
over time understood the importance and cost-
effectiveness of pre-emptive legal guidance at 
the inception or structuring stage of a deal rather 
than just legal risk vetting and damage control at 
an advanced stage. 
With this change in role and perspective towards 
an in-house counsel, the role of external legal 
counsel has also evolved significantly. Corporates 
would now expect external lawyers (steered with 
the help of in-house legal teams) to align their 
legal advice with business objectives and provide 
a holistic solution to legal issues, rather than 
restricting themselves to academic or theoretical 
responses; this expectation is also heightened 
in view of the recent advancements in AI and 
automated legal tech platforms and the external 
counsels would also need to keep abreast of 
these developments and leverage them to their 
advantage. 
Some key areas in my view where the role of 
external legal counsel is expected to evolve 
significantly are:
• Knowledge hubs: General counsels are 
increasingly relying on external legal advisors 
for providing real-time legal updates, thought 
leadership, and tailored regulatory insights. 
Firms that offer continuous knowledge 
management and legal foresight will stand 
out as indispensable partners in an evolving 
corporate landscape.
• Crisis management and risk mitigation: 
Corporate clients will increasingly turn to 
external counsel for crisis preparedness 
and response, particularly in areas like 
cybersecurity breaches, reputational risks, 
and regulatory investigations.
• Cross border expertise: As businesses expand 
into multiple jurisdictions, multinational 
corporations will demand lawyers whoAlumni in Focus 
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 20258
can navigate international trade laws, tax 
structures, and geopolitical risks, making global 
legal networks more valuable than ever.
What strategies do you implement to remain 
at the forefront of such a dynamic and ever-
changing industry?
Some key strategies would be to (1) communicate 
frequently with non-legal functions (investment, 
technical, HR, treasury) and participate actively 
in leadership discussions to gain an in-depth 
perspective of the commercials of a deal; (2) keep 
abreast of legal developments and regulatory 
trends through continuous personal knowledge 
building, internal training programmes and 
attending industry conferences and legal 
summits; (3) adopt AI-driven tools for monitoring 
legal developments to enhance efficiency and 
reduce manual workload.
Could you recommend a book that has particularly 
inspired you recently?
I’m not a huge fan of motivational/self-help books 
but I read Stanley Tucci’s ‘Taste’ recently and was 
deeply inspired by his ability to navigate through 
some really challenging life situations with the 
help of a healthy dose of dry humour sand his 
unwavering passion for good food and simple 
joys of life, something I can deeply relate to!
What is one piece of advice you have received 
throughout your career that continues to 
resonate with you?
My key takeaway from working in two of the 
largest and best law firms in the country is that the 
best way to approach any legal issue – whether 
as an external counsel or in-house counsel – is 
to be solution-oriented. Whilst as lawyers our 
primary job is to educate our clients on what is 
legally permissible or not, what ultimately creates 
long-lasting value is the ability to structure a 
practically feasible solution which is legally 
sound yet achieves the commercial objectives. It 
is important to avoid being reined in too much 
by what is ‘market standard’ and to be open 
to exploring unprecedented options so long as commercial position is not compromised and 
legal risks are avoided. I believe it is this ability 
which, in the long run, will set us apart from AI 
and keep the legal function relevant and critical 
in a rapidly changing world.
How do you manage to strike a balance between 
the demands of a high-pressure legal career and 
pursuing your personal passions like travel and 
social media?
By training the mind to (A) switch off from all 
work-relating thinking immediately once I step 
out of office; and (B) switch right back on if some 
urgent work assignment came up at odd times 
(which was frequently the case). It’s easier said 
than done, of course!
On a more serious note, I try to always clearly 
define priorities when it comes to work-life 
balance – the topmost one being physical health 
and mental wellbeing, as that ultimately and 
directly contributes to greater productivity and 
efficiency at work. It is so important to dedicate 
at least an hour a day entirely and without 
distractions to a focused exercise and meditation 
regime.
I also set personal goals based on my own 
capacity rather than comparing myself to others 
in the profession or being influenced by external 
expectations or judgement. This approach allows 
me to stay focused, fulfilled, and fully engaged 
in both my career and personal passions. It 
is important to treat recreational activities as 
contributing to personal growth and success as 
much as work/career related pursuits and not 
attach any sort of guilt or judgement to those.
To manage work stress, the best thing to do, in my 
opinion, is to break down and organise multiple 
work assignments, prioritise them according 
to client/employer expectations and then just 
deal with each of them one by one, working on 
steadily pushing each item off the plate. The 
attitude towards approaching a stressful work 
assignment is also crucial – an optimistic and 
solution-oriented approach to attacking a work 
assignment goes a long way.

In conversation with  
Madhuparna Dasgupta 
Director - Legal at Altico Advisors
The best way to approach any legal 
issue – whether as an external 
counsel or in-house counsel – is to 
be solution-oriented
- Madhuparna Dasgupta on the one piece of professional advice       
   that resonates with her.
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 2025 6
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 20257Please share your career progression following 
your tenure at Khaitan & Co. What motivated your 
transition to your current role as the Director - 
Legal at Altico Advisors?
I had recently been promoted to Partner at 
Khaitan & Co. when Altico approached me for 
a senior role in their legal team. At the same 
time, I had completed a decade in the law firm 
environment, dedicating myself to sustained 
vertical growth and establishing deep expertise 
in my practice area (Banking & Finance). Whilst 
I felt like I had achieved my personal goal of 
becoming a subject-matter expert, I saw this as 
the right opportunity to broaden my perspective 
and gain horizontal growth by diversifying 
my experience beyond a law firm setting. The 
transition to Altico allowed me to apply my law 
firm expertise in a new context while expanding 
my strategic and commercial acumen. Altico was 
also a client and I was familiar with their legal and 
investment teams and work ethic and this also 
helped with a smooth transition.
Based on your experience, how does working in 
a law firm environment differ from an in-house 
role?
The most apparent difference is that in a law firm 
you would be servicing multiple clients on specific 
assignments, typically requiring deep expertise in 
a particular field of law. Once you assume an in-
house legal role, your focus moves to providing 
legal support to a single organisation and 
handling a wide range of issues, from contracts 
and compliance to risk management and business 
strategy. Given that your involvement would go 
beyond completion of a legal mandate, there is 
a greater sense of ownership and a deeper and 
more practical understanding of the commercial 
objectives of a deal.
In your perspective, how do you foresee the role 
of legal counsel evolving in the coming years?
Traditionally, in-house legal teams were viewed 
as a cost center—a necessary but non-revenue-
generating function responsible for risk mitigation, 
compliance, and handling legal disputes. Legal 
teams often operating in silos, engaging with 
business functions only when required. Law 
firm associates would probably relate deeply to 
the frequent dilemma posed by ‘business team’ and ‘legal team’ comments appearing in drafts 
completely segregated and often at variance to 
each other! 
However, this perception has changed 
dramatically in recent years and I believe, will 
continue to evolve significantly in the coming 
years. General counsels are now frequently 
seen as business enablers and corporates have 
over time understood the importance and cost-
effectiveness of pre-emptive legal guidance at 
the inception or structuring stage of a deal rather 
than just legal risk vetting and damage control at 
an advanced stage. 
With this change in role and perspective towards 
an in-house counsel, the role of external legal 
counsel has also evolved significantly. Corporates 
would now expect external lawyers (steered with 
the help of in-house legal teams) to align their 
legal advice with business objectives and provide 
a holistic solution to legal issues, rather than 
restricting themselves to academic or theoretical 
responses; this expectation is also heightened 
in view of the recent advancements in AI and 
automated legal tech platforms and the external 
counsels would also need to keep abreast of 
these developments and leverage them to their 
advantage. 
Some key areas in my view where the role of 
external legal counsel is expected to evolve 
significantly are:
• Knowledge hubs: General counsels are 
increasingly relying on external legal advisors 
for providing real-time legal updates, thought 
leadership, and tailored regulatory insights. 
Firms that offer continuous knowledge 
management and legal foresight will stand 
out as indispensable partners in an evolving 
corporate landscape.
• Crisis management and risk mitigation: 
Corporate clients will increasingly turn to 
external counsel for crisis preparedness 
and response, particularly in areas like 
cybersecurity breaches, reputational risks, 
and regulatory investigations.
• Cross border expertise: As businesses expand 
into multiple jurisdictions, multinational 
corporations will demand lawyers whoAlumni in Focus 
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 20258
can navigate international trade laws, tax 
structures, and geopolitical risks, making global 
legal networks more valuable than ever.
What strategies do you implement to remain 
at the forefront of such a dynamic and ever-
changing industry?
Some key strategies would be to (1) communicate 
frequently with non-legal functions (investment, 
technical, HR, treasury) and participate actively 
in leadership discussions to gain an in-depth 
perspective of the commercials of a deal; (2) keep 
abreast of legal developments and regulatory 
trends through continuous personal knowledge 
building, internal training programmes and 
attending industry conferences and legal 
summits; (3) adopt AI-driven tools for monitoring 
legal developments to enhance efficiency and 
reduce manual workload.
Could you recommend a book that has particularly 
inspired you recently?
I’m not a huge fan of motivational/self-help books 
but I read Stanley Tucci’s ‘Taste’ recently and was 
deeply inspired by his ability to navigate through 
some really challenging life situations with the 
help of a healthy dose of dry humour sand his 
unwavering passion for good food and simple 
joys of life, something I can deeply relate to!
What is one piece of advice you have received 
throughout your career that continues to 
resonate with you?
My key takeaway from working in two of the 
largest and best law firms in the country is that the 
best way to approach any legal issue – whether 
as an external counsel or in-house counsel – is 
to be solution-oriented. Whilst as lawyers our 
primary job is to educate our clients on what is 
legally permissible or not, what ultimately creates 
long-lasting value is the ability to structure a 
practically feasible solution which is legally 
sound yet achieves the commercial objectives. It 
is important to avoid being reined in too much 
by what is ‘market standard’ and to be open 
to exploring unprecedented options so long as commercial position is not compromised and 
legal risks are avoided. I believe it is this ability 
which, in the long run, will set us apart from AI 
and keep the legal function relevant and critical 
in a rapidly changing world.
How do you manage to strike a balance between 
the demands of a high-pressure legal career and 
pursuing your personal passions like travel and 
social media?
By training the mind to (A) switch off from all 
work-relating thinking immediately once I step 
out of office; and (B) switch right back on if some 
urgent work assignment came up at odd times 
(which was frequently the case). It’s easier said 
than done, of course!
On a more serious note, I try to always clearly 
define priorities when it comes to work-life 
balance – the topmost one being physical health 
and mental wellbeing, as that ultimately and 
directly contributes to greater productivity and 
efficiency at work. It is so important to dedicate 
at least an hour a day entirely and without 
distractions to a focused exercise and meditation 
regime.
I also set personal goals based on my own 
capacity rather than comparing myself to others 
in the profession or being influenced by external 
expectations or judgement. This approach allows 
me to stay focused, fulfilled, and fully engaged 
in both my career and personal passions. It 
is important to treat recreational activities as 
contributing to personal growth and success as 
much as work/career related pursuits and not 
attach any sort of guilt or judgement to those.
To manage work stress, the best thing to do, in my 
opinion, is to break down and organise multiple 
work assignments, prioritise them according 
to client/employer expectations and then just 
deal with each of them one by one, working on 
steadily pushing each item off the plate. The 
attitude towards approaching a stressful work 
assignment is also crucial – an optimistic and 
solution-oriented approach to attacking a work 
assignment goes a long way.

In conversation with  
Madhuparna Dasgupta 
Director - Legal at Altico Advisors
The best way to approach any legal 
issue – whether as an external 
counsel or in-house counsel – is to 
be solution-oriented
- Madhuparna Dasgupta on the one piece of professional advice       
   that resonates with her.
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 2025 6
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 20257Please share your career progression following 
your tenure at Khaitan & Co. What motivated your 
transition to your current role as the Director - 
Legal at Altico Advisors?
I had recently been promoted to Partner at 
Khaitan & Co. when Altico approached me for 
a senior role in their legal team. At the same 
time, I had completed a decade in the law firm 
environment, dedicating myself to sustained 
vertical growth and establishing deep expertise 
in my practice area (Banking & Finance). Whilst 
I felt like I had achieved my personal goal of 
becoming a subject-matter expert, I saw this as 
the right opportunity to broaden my perspective 
and gain horizontal growth by diversifying 
my experience beyond a law firm setting. The 
transition to Altico allowed me to apply my law 
firm expertise in a new context while expanding 
my strategic and commercial acumen. Altico was 
also a client and I was familiar with their legal and 
investment teams and work ethic and this also 
helped with a smooth transition.
Based on your experience, how does working in 
a law firm environment differ from an in-house 
role?
The most apparent difference is that in a law firm 
you would be servicing multiple clients on specific 
assignments, typically requiring deep expertise in 
a particular field of law. Once you assume an in-
house legal role, your focus moves to providing 
legal support to a single organisation and 
handling a wide range of issues, from contracts 
and compliance to risk management and business 
strategy. Given that your involvement would go 
beyond completion of a legal mandate, there is 
a greater sense of ownership and a deeper and 
more practical understanding of the commercial 
objectives of a deal.
In your perspective, how do you foresee the role 
of legal counsel evolving in the coming years?
Traditionally, in-house legal teams were viewed 
as a cost center—a necessary but non-revenue-
generating function responsible for risk mitigation, 
compliance, and handling legal disputes. Legal 
teams often operating in silos, engaging with 
business functions only when required. Law 
firm associates would probably relate deeply to 
the frequent dilemma posed by ‘business team’ and ‘legal team’ comments appearing in drafts 
completely segregated and often at variance to 
each other! 
However, this perception has changed 
dramatically in recent years and I believe, will 
continue to evolve significantly in the coming 
years. General counsels are now frequently 
seen as business enablers and corporates have 
over time understood the importance and cost-
effectiveness of pre-emptive legal guidance at 
the inception or structuring stage of a deal rather 
than just legal risk vetting and damage control at 
an advanced stage. 
With this change in role and perspective towards 
an in-house counsel, the role of external legal 
counsel has also evolved significantly. Corporates 
would now expect external lawyers (steered with 
the help of in-house legal teams) to align their 
legal advice with business objectives and provide 
a holistic solution to legal issues, rather than 
restricting themselves to academic or theoretical 
responses; this expectation is also heightened 
in view of the recent advancements in AI and 
automated legal tech platforms and the external 
counsels would also need to keep abreast of 
these developments and leverage them to their 
advantage. 
Some key areas in my view where the role of 
external legal counsel is expected to evolve 
significantly are:
• Knowledge hubs: General counsels are 
increasingly relying on external legal advisors 
for providing real-time legal updates, thought 
leadership, and tailored regulatory insights. 
Firms that offer continuous knowledge 
management and legal foresight will stand 
out as indispensable partners in an evolving 
corporate landscape.
• Crisis management and risk mitigation: 
Corporate clients will increasingly turn to 
external counsel for crisis preparedness 
and response, particularly in areas like 
cybersecurity breaches, reputational risks, 
and regulatory investigations.
• Cross border expertise: As businesses expand 
into multiple jurisdictions, multinational 
corporations will demand lawyers whoAlumni in Focus 
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 20258
can navigate international trade laws, tax 
structures, and geopolitical risks, making global 
legal networks more valuable than ever.
What strategies do you implement to remain 
at the forefront of such a dynamic and ever-
changing industry?
Some key strategies would be to (1) communicate 
frequently with non-legal functions (investment, 
technical, HR, treasury) and participate actively 
in leadership discussions to gain an in-depth 
perspective of the commercials of a deal; (2) keep 
abreast of legal developments and regulatory 
trends through continuous personal knowledge 
building, internal training programmes and 
attending industry conferences and legal 
summits; (3) adopt AI-driven tools for monitoring 
legal developments to enhance efficiency and 
reduce manual workload.
Could you recommend a book that has particularly 
inspired you recently?
I’m not a huge fan of motivational/self-help books 
but I read Stanley Tucci’s ‘Taste’ recently and was 
deeply inspired by his ability to navigate through 
some really challenging life situations with the 
help of a healthy dose of dry humour sand his 
unwavering passion for good food and simple 
joys of life, something I can deeply relate to!
What is one piece of advice you have received 
throughout your career that continues to 
resonate with you?
My key takeaway from working in two of the 
largest and best law firms in the country is that the 
best way to approach any legal issue – whether 
as an external counsel or in-house counsel – is 
to be solution-oriented. Whilst as lawyers our 
primary job is to educate our clients on what is 
legally permissible or not, what ultimately creates 
long-lasting value is the ability to structure a 
practically feasible solution which is legally 
sound yet achieves the commercial objectives. It 
is important to avoid being reined in too much 
by what is ‘market standard’ and to be open 
to exploring unprecedented options so long as commercial position is not compromised and 
legal risks are avoided. I believe it is this ability 
which, in the long run, will set us apart from AI 
and keep the legal function relevant and critical 
in a rapidly changing world.
How do you manage to strike a balance between 
the demands of a high-pressure legal career and 
pursuing your personal passions like travel and 
social media?
By training the mind to (A) switch off from all 
work-relating thinking immediately once I step 
out of office; and (B) switch right back on if some 
urgent work assignment came up at odd times 
(which was frequently the case). It’s easier said 
than done, of course!
On a more serious note, I try to always clearly 
define priorities when it comes to work-life 
balance – the topmost one being physical health 
and mental wellbeing, as that ultimately and 
directly contributes to greater productivity and 
efficiency at work. It is so important to dedicate 
at least an hour a day entirely and without 
distractions to a focused exercise and meditation 
regime.
I also set personal goals based on my own 
capacity rather than comparing myself to others 
in the profession or being influenced by external 
expectations or judgement. This approach allows 
me to stay focused, fulfilled, and fully engaged 
in both my career and personal passions. It 
is important to treat recreational activities as 
contributing to personal growth and success as 
much as work/career related pursuits and not 
attach any sort of guilt or judgement to those.
To manage work stress, the best thing to do, in my 
opinion, is to break down and organise multiple 
work assignments, prioritise them according 
to client/employer expectations and then just 
deal with each of them one by one, working on 
steadily pushing each item off the plate. The 
attitude towards approaching a stressful work 
assignment is also crucial – an optimistic and 
solution-oriented approach to attacking a work 
assignment goes a long way.

In conversation with  
Madhuparna Dasgupta 
Director - Legal at Altico Advisors
The best way to approach any legal 
issue – whether as an external 
counsel or in-house counsel – is to 
be solution-oriented
- Madhuparna Dasgupta on the one piece of professional advice       
   that resonates with her.
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 2025 6
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 20257Please share your career progression following 
your tenure at Khaitan & Co. What motivated your 
transition to your current role as the Director - 
Legal at Altico Advisors?
I had recently been promoted to Partner at 
Khaitan & Co. when Altico approached me for 
a senior role in their legal team. At the same 
time, I had completed a decade in the law firm 
environment, dedicating myself to sustained 
vertical growth and establishing deep expertise 
in my practice area (Banking & Finance). Whilst 
I felt like I had achieved my personal goal of 
becoming a subject-matter expert, I saw this as 
the right opportunity to broaden my perspective 
and gain horizontal growth by diversifying 
my experience beyond a law firm setting. The 
transition to Altico allowed me to apply my law 
firm expertise in a new context while expanding 
my strategic and commercial acumen. Altico was 
also a client and I was familiar with their legal and 
investment teams and work ethic and this also 
helped with a smooth transition.
Based on your experience, how does working in 
a law firm environment differ from an in-house 
role?
The most apparent difference is that in a law firm 
you would be servicing multiple clients on specific 
assignments, typically requiring deep expertise in 
a particular field of law. Once you assume an in-
house legal role, your focus moves to providing 
legal support to a single organisation and 
handling a wide range of issues, from contracts 
and compliance to risk management and business 
strategy. Given that your involvement would go 
beyond completion of a legal mandate, there is 
a greater sense of ownership and a deeper and 
more practical understanding of the commercial 
objectives of a deal.
In your perspective, how do you foresee the role 
of legal counsel evolving in the coming years?
Traditionally, in-house legal teams were viewed 
as a cost center—a necessary but non-revenue-
generating function responsible for risk mitigation, 
compliance, and handling legal disputes. Legal 
teams often operating in silos, engaging with 
business functions only when required. Law 
firm associates would probably relate deeply to 
the frequent dilemma posed by ‘business team’ and ‘legal team’ comments appearing in drafts 
completely segregated and often at variance to 
each other! 
However, this perception has changed 
dramatically in recent years and I believe, will 
continue to evolve significantly in the coming 
years. General counsels are now frequently 
seen as business enablers and corporates have 
over time understood the importance and cost-
effectiveness of pre-emptive legal guidance at 
the inception or structuring stage of a deal rather 
than just legal risk vetting and damage control at 
an advanced stage. 
With this change in role and perspective towards 
an in-house counsel, the role of external legal 
counsel has also evolved significantly. Corporates 
would now expect external lawyers (steered with 
the help of in-house legal teams) to align their 
legal advice with business objectives and provide 
a holistic solution to legal issues, rather than 
restricting themselves to academic or theoretical 
responses; this expectation is also heightened 
in view of the recent advancements in AI and 
automated legal tech platforms and the external 
counsels would also need to keep abreast of 
these developments and leverage them to their 
advantage. 
Some key areas in my view where the role of 
external legal counsel is expected to evolve 
significantly are:
• Knowledge hubs: General counsels are 
increasingly relying on external legal advisors 
for providing real-time legal updates, thought 
leadership, and tailored regulatory insights. 
Firms that offer continuous knowledge 
management and legal foresight will stand 
out as indispensable partners in an evolving 
corporate landscape.
• Crisis management and risk mitigation: 
Corporate clients will increasingly turn to 
external counsel for crisis preparedness 
and response, particularly in areas like 
cybersecurity breaches, reputational risks, 
and regulatory investigations.
• Cross border expertise: As businesses expand 
into multiple jurisdictions, multinational 
corporations will demand lawyers whoAlumni in Focus 
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 20258
can navigate international trade laws, tax 
structures, and geopolitical risks, making global 
legal networks more valuable than ever.
What strategies do you implement to remain 
at the forefront of such a dynamic and ever-
changing industry?
Some key strategies would be to (1) communicate 
frequently with non-legal functions (investment, 
technical, HR, treasury) and participate actively 
in leadership discussions to gain an in-depth 
perspective of the commercials of a deal; (2) keep 
abreast of legal developments and regulatory 
trends through continuous personal knowledge 
building, internal training programmes and 
attending industry conferences and legal 
summits; (3) adopt AI-driven tools for monitoring 
legal developments to enhance efficiency and 
reduce manual workload.
Could you recommend a book that has particularly 
inspired you recently?
I’m not a huge fan of motivational/self-help books 
but I read Stanley Tucci’s ‘Taste’ recently and was 
deeply inspired by his ability to navigate through 
some really challenging life situations with the 
help of a healthy dose of dry humour sand his 
unwavering passion for good food and simple 
joys of life, something I can deeply relate to!
What is one piece of advice you have received 
throughout your career that continues to 
resonate with you?
My key takeaway from working in two of the 
largest and best law firms in the country is that the 
best way to approach any legal issue – whether 
as an external counsel or in-house counsel – is 
to be solution-oriented. Whilst as lawyers our 
primary job is to educate our clients on what is 
legally permissible or not, what ultimately creates 
long-lasting value is the ability to structure a 
practically feasible solution which is legally 
sound yet achieves the commercial objectives. It 
is important to avoid being reined in too much 
by what is ‘market standard’ and to be open 
to exploring unprecedented options so long as commercial position is not compromised and 
legal risks are avoided. I believe it is this ability 
which, in the long run, will set us apart from AI 
and keep the legal function relevant and critical 
in a rapidly changing world.
How do you manage to strike a balance between 
the demands of a high-pressure legal career and 
pursuing your personal passions like travel and 
social media?
By training the mind to (A) switch off from all 
work-relating thinking immediately once I step 
out of office; and (B) switch right back on if some 
urgent work assignment came up at odd times 
(which was frequently the case). It’s easier said 
than done, of course!
On a more serious note, I try to always clearly 
define priorities when it comes to work-life 
balance – the topmost one being physical health 
and mental wellbeing, as that ultimately and 
directly contributes to greater productivity and 
efficiency at work. It is so important to dedicate 
at least an hour a day entirely and without 
distractions to a focused exercise and meditation 
regime.
I also set personal goals based on my own 
capacity rather than comparing myself to others 
in the profession or being influenced by external 
expectations or judgement. This approach allows 
me to stay focused, fulfilled, and fully engaged 
in both my career and personal passions. It 
is important to treat recreational activities as 
contributing to personal growth and success as 
much as work/career related pursuits and not 
attach any sort of guilt or judgement to those.
To manage work stress, the best thing to do, in my 
opinion, is to break down and organise multiple 
work assignments, prioritise them according 
to client/employer expectations and then just 
deal with each of them one by one, working on 
steadily pushing each item off the plate. The 
attitude towards approaching a stressful work 
assignment is also crucial – an optimistic and 
solution-oriented approach to attacking a work 
assignment goes a long way.

In conversation with  
Madhuparna Dasgupta 
Director - Legal at Altico Advisors
The best way to approach any legal 
issue – whether as an external 
counsel or in-house counsel – is to 
be solution-oriented
- Madhuparna Dasgupta on the one piece of professional advice       
   that resonates with her.
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 2025 6
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 20257Please share your career progression following 
your tenure at Khaitan & Co. What motivated your 
transition to your current role as the Director - 
Legal at Altico Advisors?
I had recently been promoted to Partner at 
Khaitan & Co. when Altico approached me for 
a senior role in their legal team. At the same 
time, I had completed a decade in the law firm 
environment, dedicating myself to sustained 
vertical growth and establishing deep expertise 
in my practice area (Banking & Finance). Whilst 
I felt like I had achieved my personal goal of 
becoming a subject-matter expert, I saw this as 
the right opportunity to broaden my perspective 
and gain horizontal growth by diversifying 
my experience beyond a law firm setting. The 
transition to Altico allowed me to apply my law 
firm expertise in a new context while expanding 
my strategic and commercial acumen. Altico was 
also a client and I was familiar with their legal and 
investment teams and work ethic and this also 
helped with a smooth transition.
Based on your experience, how does working in 
a law firm environment differ from an in-house 
role?
The most apparent difference is that in a law firm 
you would be servicing multiple clients on specific 
assignments, typically requiring deep expertise in 
a particular field of law. Once you assume an in-
house legal role, your focus moves to providing 
legal support to a single organisation and 
handling a wide range of issues, from contracts 
and compliance to risk management and business 
strategy. Given that your involvement would go 
beyond completion of a legal mandate, there is 
a greater sense of ownership and a deeper and 
more practical understanding of the commercial 
objectives of a deal.
In your perspective, how do you foresee the role 
of legal counsel evolving in the coming years?
Traditionally, in-house legal teams were viewed 
as a cost center—a necessary but non-revenue-
generating function responsible for risk mitigation, 
compliance, and handling legal disputes. Legal 
teams often operating in silos, engaging with 
business functions only when required. Law 
firm associates would probably relate deeply to 
the frequent dilemma posed by ‘business team’ and ‘legal team’ comments appearing in drafts 
completely segregated and often at variance to 
each other! 
However, this perception has changed 
dramatically in recent years and I believe, will 
continue to evolve significantly in the coming 
years. General counsels are now frequently 
seen as business enablers and corporates have 
over time understood the importance and cost-
effectiveness of pre-emptive legal guidance at 
the inception or structuring stage of a deal rather 
than just legal risk vetting and damage control at 
an advanced stage. 
With this change in role and perspective towards 
an in-house counsel, the role of external legal 
counsel has also evolved significantly. Corporates 
would now expect external lawyers (steered with 
the help of in-house legal teams) to align their 
legal advice with business objectives and provide 
a holistic solution to legal issues, rather than 
restricting themselves to academic or theoretical 
responses; this expectation is also heightened 
in view of the recent advancements in AI and 
automated legal tech platforms and the external 
counsels would also need to keep abreast of 
these developments and leverage them to their 
advantage. 
Some key areas in my view where the role of 
external legal counsel is expected to evolve 
significantly are:
• Knowledge hubs: General counsels are 
increasingly relying on external legal advisors 
for providing real-time legal updates, thought 
leadership, and tailored regulatory insights. 
Firms that offer continuous knowledge 
management and legal foresight will stand 
out as indispensable partners in an evolving 
corporate landscape.
• Crisis management and risk mitigation: 
Corporate clients will increasingly turn to 
external counsel for crisis preparedness 
and response, particularly in areas like 
cybersecurity breaches, reputational risks, 
and regulatory investigations.
• Cross border expertise: As businesses expand 
into multiple jurisdictions, multinational 
corporations will demand lawyers whoAlumni in Focus 
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 20258
can navigate international trade laws, tax 
structures, and geopolitical risks, making global 
legal networks more valuable than ever.
What strategies do you implement to remain 
at the forefront of such a dynamic and ever-
changing industry?
Some key strategies would be to (1) communicate 
frequently with non-legal functions (investment, 
technical, HR, treasury) and participate actively 
in leadership discussions to gain an in-depth 
perspective of the commercials of a deal; (2) keep 
abreast of legal developments and regulatory 
trends through continuous personal knowledge 
building, internal training programmes and 
attending industry conferences and legal 
summits; (3) adopt AI-driven tools for monitoring 
legal developments to enhance efficiency and 
reduce manual workload.
Could you recommend a book that has particularly 
inspired you recently?
I’m not a huge fan of motivational/self-help books 
but I read Stanley Tucci’s ‘Taste’ recently and was 
deeply inspired by his ability to navigate through 
some really challenging life situations with the 
help of a healthy dose of dry humour sand his 
unwavering passion for good food and simple 
joys of life, something I can deeply relate to!
What is one piece of advice you have received 
throughout your career that continues to 
resonate with you?
My key takeaway from working in two of the 
largest and best law firms in the country is that the 
best way to approach any legal issue – whether 
as an external counsel or in-house counsel – is 
to be solution-oriented. Whilst as lawyers our 
primary job is to educate our clients on what is 
legally permissible or not, what ultimately creates 
long-lasting value is the ability to structure a 
practically feasible solution which is legally 
sound yet achieves the commercial objectives. It 
is important to avoid being reined in too much 
by what is ‘market standard’ and to be open 
to exploring unprecedented options so long as commercial position is not compromised and 
legal risks are avoided. I believe it is this ability 
which, in the long run, will set us apart from AI 
and keep the legal function relevant and critical 
in a rapidly changing world.
How do you manage to strike a balance between 
the demands of a high-pressure legal career and 
pursuing your personal passions like travel and 
social media?
By training the mind to (A) switch off from all 
work-relating thinking immediately once I step 
out of office; and (B) switch right back on if some 
urgent work assignment came up at odd times 
(which was frequently the case). It’s easier said 
than done, of course!
On a more serious note, I try to always clearly 
define priorities when it comes to work-life 
balance – the topmost one being physical health 
and mental wellbeing, as that ultimately and 
directly contributes to greater productivity and 
efficiency at work. It is so important to dedicate 
at least an hour a day entirely and without 
distractions to a focused exercise and meditation 
regime.
I also set personal goals based on my own 
capacity rather than comparing myself to others 
in the profession or being influenced by external 
expectations or judgement. This approach allows 
me to stay focused, fulfilled, and fully engaged 
in both my career and personal passions. It 
is important to treat recreational activities as 
contributing to personal growth and success as 
much as work/career related pursuits and not 
attach any sort of guilt or judgement to those.
To manage work stress, the best thing to do, in my 
opinion, is to break down and organise multiple 
work assignments, prioritise them according 
to client/employer expectations and then just 
deal with each of them one by one, working on 
steadily pushing each item off the plate. The 
attitude towards approaching a stressful work 
assignment is also crucial – an optimistic and 
solution-oriented approach to attacking a work 
assignment goes a long way.

In conversation with  
Madhuparna Dasgupta 
Director - Legal at Altico Advisors
The best way to approach any legal 
issue – whether as an external 
counsel or in-house counsel – is to 
be solution-oriented
- Madhuparna Dasgupta on the one piece of professional advice       
   that resonates with her.
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 2025 6
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 20257Please share your career progression following 
your tenure at Khaitan & Co. What motivated your 
transition to your current role as the Director - 
Legal at Altico Advisors?
I had recently been promoted to Partner at 
Khaitan & Co. when Altico approached me for 
a senior role in their legal team. At the same 
time, I had completed a decade in the law firm 
environment, dedicating myself to sustained 
vertical growth and establishing deep expertise 
in my practice area (Banking & Finance). Whilst 
I felt like I had achieved my personal goal of 
becoming a subject-matter expert, I saw this as 
the right opportunity to broaden my perspective 
and gain horizontal growth by diversifying 
my experience beyond a law firm setting. The 
transition to Altico allowed me to apply my law 
firm expertise in a new context while expanding 
my strategic and commercial acumen. Altico was 
also a client and I was familiar with their legal and 
investment teams and work ethic and this also 
helped with a smooth transition.
Based on your experience, how does working in 
a law firm environment differ from an in-house 
role?
The most apparent difference is that in a law firm 
you would be servicing multiple clients on specific 
assignments, typically requiring deep expertise in 
a particular field of law. Once you assume an in-
house legal role, your focus moves to providing 
legal support to a single organisation and 
handling a wide range of issues, from contracts 
and compliance to risk management and business 
strategy. Given that your involvement would go 
beyond completion of a legal mandate, there is 
a greater sense of ownership and a deeper and 
more practical understanding of the commercial 
objectives of a deal.
In your perspective, how do you foresee the role 
of legal counsel evolving in the coming years?
Traditionally, in-house legal teams were viewed 
as a cost center—a necessary but non-revenue-
generating function responsible for risk mitigation, 
compliance, and handling legal disputes. Legal 
teams often operating in silos, engaging with 
business functions only when required. Law 
firm associates would probably relate deeply to 
the frequent dilemma posed by ‘business team’ and ‘legal team’ comments appearing in drafts 
completely segregated and often at variance to 
each other! 
However, this perception has changed 
dramatically in recent years and I believe, will 
continue to evolve significantly in the coming 
years. General counsels are now frequently 
seen as business enablers and corporates have 
over time understood the importance and cost-
effectiveness of pre-emptive legal guidance at 
the inception or structuring stage of a deal rather 
than just legal risk vetting and damage control at 
an advanced stage. 
With this change in role and perspective towards 
an in-house counsel, the role of external legal 
counsel has also evolved significantly. Corporates 
would now expect external lawyers (steered with 
the help of in-house legal teams) to align their 
legal advice with business objectives and provide 
a holistic solution to legal issues, rather than 
restricting themselves to academic or theoretical 
responses; this expectation is also heightened 
in view of the recent advancements in AI and 
automated legal tech platforms and the external 
counsels would also need to keep abreast of 
these developments and leverage them to their 
advantage. 
Some key areas in my view where the role of 
external legal counsel is expected to evolve 
significantly are:
• Knowledge hubs: General counsels are 
increasingly relying on external legal advisors 
for providing real-time legal updates, thought 
leadership, and tailored regulatory insights. 
Firms that offer continuous knowledge 
management and legal foresight will stand 
out as indispensable partners in an evolving 
corporate landscape.
• Crisis management and risk mitigation: 
Corporate clients will increasingly turn to 
external counsel for crisis preparedness 
and response, particularly in areas like 
cybersecurity breaches, reputational risks, 
and regulatory investigations.
• Cross border expertise: As businesses expand 
into multiple jurisdictions, multinational 
corporations will demand lawyers whoAlumni in Focus 
KCONNECT ALUMNI NEWSLETTER 20258
can navigate international trade laws, tax 
structures, and geopolitical risks, making global 
legal networks more valuable than ever.
What strategies do you implement to remain 
at the forefront of such a dynamic and ever-
changing industry?
Some key strategies would be to (1) communicate 
frequently with non-legal functions (investment, 
technical, HR, treasury) and participate actively 
in leadership discussions to gain an in-depth 
perspective of the commercials of a deal; (2) keep 
abreast of legal developments and regulatory 
trends through continuous personal knowledge 
building, internal training programmes and 
attending industry conferences and legal 
summits; (3) adopt AI-driven tools for monitoring 
legal developments to enhance efficiency and 
reduce manual workload.
Could you recommend a book that has particularly 
inspired you recently?
I’m not a huge fan of motivational/self-help books 
but I read Stanley Tucci’s ‘Taste’ recently and was 
deeply inspired by his ability to navigate through 
some really challenging life situations with the 
help of a healthy dose of dry humour sand his 
unwavering passion for good food and simple 
joys of life, something I can deeply relate to!
What is one piece of advice you have received 
throughout your career that continues to 
resonate with you?
My key takeaway from working in two of the 
largest and best law firms in the country is that the 
best way to approach any legal issue – whether 
as an external counsel or in-house counsel – is 
to be solution-oriented. Whilst as lawyers our 
primary job is to educate our clients on what is 
legally permissible or not, what ultimately creates 
long-lasting value is the ability to structure a 
practically feasible solution which is legally 
sound yet achieves the commercial objectives. It 
is important to avoid being reined in too much 
by what is ‘market standard’ and to be open 
to exploring unprecedented options so long as commercial position is not compromised and 
legal risks are avoided. I believe it is this ability 
which, in the long run, will set us apart from AI 
and keep the legal function relevant and critical 
in a rapidly changing world.
How do you manage to strike a balance between 
the demands of a high-pressure legal career and 
pursuing your personal passions like travel and 
social media?
By training the mind to (A) switch off from all 
work-relating thinking immediately once I step 
out of office; and (B) switch right back on if some 
urgent work assignment came up at odd times 
(which was frequently the case). It’s easier said 
than done, of course!
On a more serious note, I try to always clearly 
define priorities when it comes to work-life 
balance – the topmost one being physical health 
and mental wellbeing, as that ultimately and 
directly contributes to greater productivity and 
efficiency at work. It is so important to dedicate 
at least an hour a day entirely and without 
distractions to a focused exercise and meditation 
regime.
I also set personal goals based on my own 
capacity rather than comparing myself to others 
in the profession or being influenced by external 
expectations or judgement. This approach allows 
me to stay focused, fulfilled, and fully engaged 
in both my career and personal passions. It 
is important to treat recreational activities as 
contributing to personal growth and success as 
much as work/career related pursuits and not 
attach any sort of guilt or judgement to those.
To manage work stress, the best thing to do, in my 
opinion, is to break down and organise multiple 
work assignments, prioritise them according 
to client/employer expectations and then just 
deal with each of them one by one, working on 
steadily pushing each item off the plate. The 
attitude towards approaching a stressful work 
assignment is also crucial – an optimistic and 
solution-oriented approach to attacking a work 
assignment goes a long way.
